Hello, I'm SungWon Kwak in Rome, Italy. I am a Ph.D student at the University of Rome (joint by Sapienza and Tor Vergata) and study the Galactic Halo and its formation scenario by comparing a large catalog of RR Lyrae variables (~180,000) and [the AURIGA simulations](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/auriga/). My thesis also covers several interesting numerical studies on bulge/disk regarding the metallicity gradients in nearby late-type galaxies, and on the dark matter Halo of the Milky Way regarding its size, shape, and spin axis alignment with the stellar Halo and the Bulge. You can find [my CV here](./file/CV_Kwak.pdf).

Before coming to Rome, I've been to many cities around the world. I was born in **Daejeon**, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and my family moved to **Seoul** when I was 10. After finishing my middle school in Seoul, I went to **USA** alone to study abroad. I went to a high school in **Las Vegas** for a semester and then transferred to the Storm King high school in **New York** where I graduated from. I started my undergraduate as an engineering major, but later became more interested in the outer world, so ended up getting double degrees in astronomy and physics at the University of Washington, **Seattle**. After spending one semester in **Geneva, Switzerland** as an internship student at CERN, I did my M.S. in Astronomy at Seoul National Univeristy and spent 3 years for mandatory military service in Daejeon, Korea. Now, I'm in **Rome, Italy**, and looking for a new place to continue my study and journey.
